## Colorization of Black and White Images through Deep Learning Methods

There are multiple deep learning based solutions currently present for colorization of black and white images, with varying performances. Our project as part of the Deep Learning course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique was centered on implementing and comparing the different solutions, and providing examples of colorized images through different methods.
